# Introdution

Maya is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content first. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating content management from content consumption on the client side.

Maya is focusing just on the back-end work to manage content. Rather than worry about delivery of content through pages, its goal is to provide structured content across different channels via a simple API.

## Key features:

- **Manage flexible content models.** There are no pre-defined content models. Define the content model yourself.
- **Uncluttered UI.** Maya offers you a modern and simple user interface.
- **One system, consume it the way you want.** Receive your content via a simple API.
